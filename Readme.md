# üöÄ HNG Frontend Wizards Stage 1: Multi-Page Profile-Card

This repository contains the solution for the Frontend Wizards Stage 1 challenge, which involved scaling a single component (Stage 0 Profile Card) into a cohesive, multi-page application. The project adheres strictly to requirements for **semantic HTML, accessibility, responsiveness, and testability**.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Technical Highlights

This project demonstrates core modern frontend skills across three fully accessible pages:

1.  **Semantic Structure:** Uses appropriate HTML5 semantics (`<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<h2>` hierarchy) throughout all pages.
2.  **Full Testability:** Every required element includes the specified `data-testid` attribute, ensuring the application is ready for automated testing.
3.  **Advanced Form Validation (Contact Page):**
    * Implemented robust client-side validation using **Vanilla JavaScript**.
    * Checks for required fields, valid email format (via Regex), and a minimum message length (10 words).
    * Provides clear, accessible error feedback using `aria-describedby` and `aria-live="polite"`.
4.  **Accessibility (A11Y):**
    * All interactive elements are **Keyboard Navigable** with visible focus states.
    * Labels are correctly linked to inputs (`<label for="">`).
    * Proper use of ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility.
5.  **Responsive Design:** Utilizes modern CSS (Flexbox) to ensure the layout adapts seamlessly from mobile (stacked) to desktop (multi-column) views.
