# üöÄ HNG Internship Frontend Task __Stage 0__: Testable Profile Card
This project is the Stage 0 task for the HNG Internship Frontend program, focused on building a small, accessible, and testable profile card component using only semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## ‚ú® Features
 * Semantic HTML: Uses appropriate tags (<article>, <figure>, <h2>, <nav>) for improved structure and accessibility.
 * Highly Testable: Every visible, required element includes the specific data-testid attributes required for automated testing.
 * Responsive Layout: The card layout adjusts cleanly for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using Flexbox or Grid.
 * Dynamic Time: Displays the current time in milliseconds using pure vanilla JavaScript and updates it regularly.
 * Accessibility (A11y) Focused: Ensures proper focus states, keyboard navigation, and alt text for images.
